### About

This is a template Vue.js project that contains a number of boilerplate components that I cannot be bothered configuring every time I make a new project.

Some noteworthy inclusions:

1. Vue Router + Base Configuration
2. TypeScript Support
3. Font Awesome
4. Normalise.css

### Configuration

1. Change name of folder, `package.json` and `package.json.lock` references to `project_template` to the intended name of project.
2. Run `npm install` to download all dependencies

### Running the project

`npm run dev`
